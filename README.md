# MEAN-STACK-CRUD-PROJECT

Good morning everyone today i gonna represent my new MEAN STACK project . is a simple crud project , 
the goal is to give you some idea about how it work the communication between angular , node , express and mango db ! 
let's start sow : 


1- to run this project you need to install Node js in your machine ?
if you don't have to to download it from here : https://nodejs.org/en/download/ .


2-after that you have to install angular cli in order to run front end part of this project:npm install --save @angular/cli@latest 


3-this awesome ! next step is mango db go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/ sign up if you don't have an account , it's free :p don't worry 


4- let's clone it now go to the folder where you want to integrate this project , and open the terminal by typping ctrl+alt+t if you use ubuntu , shift+rightmouseclick and choose open command windows ( if you use windows ) 


5 - write this command on the terminal : git clone https://github.com/hamdirhibi/MEAN-STACK-CRUD-PROJECT.git ( try to install git if you don't in your machine : https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03  ) 


6- enter to the project by changing directory command : cd 'MEAN-STACK-CRUD-PROJECT'


7-lets install node dependencies by typping : npm install 


8- all pass good , i hope so , you have to install front end dependencies , so enter to the front project : cd Front 


9- again and again : npm install 


10 - all you need now is to run front and back end servers ! to do that you have to run : 
  -ng serve  // on the Front directory
  -npm start // on the MEAN STACK CRUD directory 

and its all , i hope it's beneficial for you guys . all the best
